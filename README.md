This is a simple but sometimes very useful tool. If you pass 2 yaml files it will compare them and show the keys of the first file that the second file is missing.
That can be handy if you develop a multilingual application and your translations are stored in yaml files. An example is a Rails framework with yaml files for every language (em.yml, ru.yml...). Many other apps use this approach too.
